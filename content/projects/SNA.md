#### CS185C - Social Network Analysis - Team Members: (Inhee | Vrinda | Anirudh)

> In June 2020, BTS (South Korean hip-hop boy group) donated one million dollars 
> for Black Lives Matter (BLM). The BTS official fanclub, called ARMY, 
> had mobilised via Twitter and decided to match the donation. They used Twitter 
> hashtags #MatchAMillion, #Match1Million and #MatchTheMillion to spread word about 
> the campaign. Within 24 hours between 7th-8th of June, 2020, the fundraising 
> account @OneInAnARMY announced that they had met their goal of 1 million dollars 
> for BLM. 
>
>BTS Army is known for supporting various causes, so the initial campaign was 
>not surprising. What was surprising was the speed at which this feat had been 
>completed. This 24 hour window became the focal point of our analysis.
